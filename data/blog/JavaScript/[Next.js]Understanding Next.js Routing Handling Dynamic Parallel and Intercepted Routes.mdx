## Preface
This is article is mainly about the [Next.js(14.x) Routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing), it won't cover everything, but it will involve some parts that are relatively difficult for me to understand. I think there might be someone has the same confusion with me, so I write this to hope this will help us.
### Target Reader
This article is neither a complete tutorial from 0 nor require extensive development experience. You only need a very basic understanding of Next.js, even if it's just creating an initial project with `npx create-next-app@latest`.
