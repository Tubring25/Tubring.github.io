## Preface

### Why I Write This

Recently, I've been diving into Next.js(14+) and creating some demo projects to practice. The file-system based router is new to me. While it's easy to grasp the basics, I found myself spending some time to understanding advanced features like Parallel Routes and Intercepting Routes.

This articel primarily focuses on [Next.js(14.x) Routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing). While it won't cover everything, it will delve into some aspects that I found a little challenging to understand. I figured there might be others out there with similar confusions, so I'm writing this in hopes of helping us all out.

### Who This Is For

This article isn't a complete beginner's guide, nor does it require extensive development experience. You only need a basic understanding of Next.js - even if it's just creating an initial project with `npx create-next-app@latest`.

Assuming you already know that Next.js uses a file-system based router, I'll skip the basics and jump straight to the Dynamic Routes section.

## Dynamic Routes

### What Are Dynamic Routes?

Dynamic routes allow us to create pages that can adapt to different paramaters in the URL. We can use a single dynamic route to handle mutiple scenarios.

### Creating Dynamic Routes

The creating of dynamic routes is quite simple, just adding brackets to a page file name. For example:

```
app/post/[slug]/page.tsx
```

This creates a dynamic route for blog posts where `[slug]` can be any value.

### Accessing Route Parameters

Inside the page component, we can access the dynamic part of the route using the `params` prop. Here's a quice example:

```typescript
// app\post\[slug]\page.tsx
export default async function BlogPost({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const post = await getBlogPost(params.slug)
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <div>{{ post.content }}</div>
    </article>
  )
}
```

### Catch-All Routes and Optional Catch-All Routes

The dynamic routes we created earlier use `[foldername]` and accept one paramater in the page component. But what if we need mutiple dynamic router paramaters? For instance, a structure like `app/shop/[category]/[id]/page.js`. This is where Catch-All Routes and Optional Catch-All Routes come in handy.

#### Catch-All Routes

Next.js offers catch-all routes using `[...folderName]`. This allow us to capture mutiple path segments. For example:

```
app/shop/[...slug]/page.js
```

This route could match:

- `/shop/clothes`

- `/shop/clothes/shirts`

- `/shop/clothes/shirts/summer`

```typescript
// app\dynamic-routes\catch-all\[...slug]\page.tsx
export default function DRCatchAllPage({ params }: { params: { slug: string[] } }) {
    const { slug } = params
    return (
        <div className="text-center">
            Current Page is Dynamic Route Page with Catch-all Segments.

            {/* slug will be an array: ['clothes', 'shirts', 'summer'] */}
            <h1>Category: {slug.join(' > ')}</h1>
        </div>
    )
}
```

// TODO: add capture

#### Optional Catch-All Routes

   By adding double brackets, we can make catch-all routes optional:

```
app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js
```

- `/shop`

- `/shop/clothes`

- `/shop/clothes/shirts/summer`
  
  The difference is that this route could work without paramaters.

```typescript
// app\dynamic-routes\optional-catch-all\shop\[[...slug]]\page.tsx

export default function DROptCatchAllPage({ params }: { params: { slug?: string[] } }) {
    return (
        <div className="text-center">
            Current Page is Dynamic Route Page with Optional Catch-all Segments.
            <br />
            The param info is: {params.slug ? params.slug.join('>') : 'empty info'}
        </div>
    )
}
```

// TODO: add capture

## Intercepting Routes

Sometimes we hope we could pause and redirect a user before they reach a certain page. Next.js provides the intercepting routes to achieve this.

### What Are Intercepting Routes

Intercepting routes in Next.js give use the power to "intercept" a route and display a different component or page than what would normaly be displayed.

### How to Create Intercepting Routes

```
intercepting-routes/
├── feed/
│   └── page.js
└── photos/
    ├── [...slug]/
    │   └── page.js
    └── (.)feed/
        └── page.js
```

In this structure, `(.)feed` is an intercepting route. The `(.)` means "intercept the sibling route".

### Types of Interceptions

Next.js offers different types of interceptions:

1. `(.)` - Intercept the same segment

2. `(..)` - Intercept the parent segment

3. `(...)` - Intercept from the root

4. `(...)` - Intercept all segments
   
   ### 

## Parallel Routes

Imagine you're cooking in your kitchen. You've got pasta boiling on the burner and bread in the oven. That's kind of what paralle routes are like in Next.js - mutiple things happening at once, but all part of the same meal (or in our case, web page).

### What Are Parallel Routes

Parallel routes in Next.js allow us to render mutiple pages or components in the same layout simultaneously.

### How to Create Parallel Routes

Creating parallel routes need to add a `@` symbol in front of the foldername. For example:

```
parallel-routes/
│── layout.tsx
│── @pasta/
│   └── page.tsx
│── @bread/
│   └── page.tsx
```

In this setup, both the `@pasta` and `@bread` components can be rendered side by side in the same layout.

> Note: Folder name with names starting with `@` are called "slots", They won't be recognized as routes even if they contain a `page.tsx` file.

To implement parallel routes, besides naming folders with `@` symbol, the `layout.tsx` file need to receive them as parameters, similar to how it receives `children`.

```typescript
export default function ParallelRoutesLayout({
  children,
  pasta,
  bread,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
  bread: React.ReactNode
  pasta: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <>
      {children}
      <div className="flex text-center">
        <div className="w-1/2 p-4">
          <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">pasta Side</h1>
          {pasta}
        </div>
        <div className="w-1/2 p-4">
          <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">bread Side</h1>
          {bread}
        </div>
      </div>
    </>
  )
}
```

The parallel routes and regular components has many things in common, but the biggest difference I think is the parallel routes come with route-like capabilities. Like loading states, error handling and default fallbacks, witch you'd have to implement manually with regular components.
