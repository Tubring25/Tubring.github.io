I'm a front-end developer who loves creating user-friendly interfaces. Open source projects drive my passion, and I'm currently expanding my skills by learning Go. 

Off the screen, I'm an avid "Person of Interest" fan, drawn to its intriguing storyline and characters. I also enjoy reading books, particularly those by Ted Chiang. 

In a nutshell, I'm a developer with a penchant for creativity and a curiosity that never stops.
